tldr: the only thing you have to do additionally to coping the files to your unity project is: open AndroidManifest.xml and edit which files/urls you want to react to with your app

Copy the complete folder "aEx_IntentHandler" to your \Plugins\Android folder, do not create a manifest in the outer "\Plugins\Android" folder, instead edit the manifest fragment in "\Plugins\Android\aEx_IntentHandler" which will be automatically merged into the manifest generated by Unity automatically 
the merge can only be done if there is a project.properties file located with the manifest file which indicates that its a library
the jar has to be placed in "\Plugins\Android\aEx_IntentHandler\libs"
the package specified in the manifest fragment does not have to be the same as the one of the application generated by unity
